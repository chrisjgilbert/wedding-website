    copy: `The easiest way to get down to the Luberon is by air. You can fly to Marseille, and then car hire and its about 50 mins drive into the Luberon. Both British Airways and Easyjet have regular flights over the summer months.  If you prefer to travel by train, Eurostar typically runs a service direct from Kings Cross to Avignon which is very civilised. Otherwise you can change in Paris or Lille on to the TGV down to Avignon. You can also hire a care from the Avignon TGV station and the drive is approximately 30 min drive into the Luberon.

    For anyone planning a longer trip, driving down to the South of France is also really fun option. We would recommend you take 2 days to do this as its about 12 hours of driving.

    We will be arriving in the Luberon the week before the wedding and staying in Lourmarin so please let us know if you are going to be in the area ahead of the wedding as we woudl love to see you.

    title: "About the venue",
    copy: `The Bastide de Marie is a hotel and location that is very close to the heart of the Thomson family. Situated just outside the village of Ménerbes, it has been the venue for many memorable meals over last 16 years of family summer holidays in the Luberon. We have enjoyed drinks on the terrace to wonderful, long and delicious suppers in the rose garden under the shade of the plane trees and by the edge of the vines. The main building is an old farmhouse which sits amongst 23 hectares of vines, producing white, red and rose wine (which you will get to know very well over the weekend!) and with a stunning outlook across the petit Luberon.

    As well as sampling the Domaine de Marie wines, the seasonal produce and modern Provençal-style cuisine is exceptional. We return year upon year and are never disappointed. We think it’s a very magical place and can’t wait to share it with you.`,
