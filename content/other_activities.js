There is an extensive and accessible network of walking paths and trails, linking villages that are often just a few miles apart. Walking trails are marked by small slashes painted on trees, rocks, utility poles, fence posts, even buildings. In many areas of the Vaucluse - including the Luberon - there is also a system of signposts with bright gold signs at key trail intersections. A really beautiful walk to try is the 3 hour between Bonnieux and Lacoste- link here for the details- https://www.theluberon.com/things-to-do/hiking-in-the-luberon/bonnieux-lacoste-hike",

If you can visit the markets are always the best place to buy fresh Provençal produce and each day a different village or town hosts a market. Otherwise there are some great supermarkets too. Fresh in Apt in one of the best supermarkets in the area- it has a particularly good selection of fresh produce if you aren’t able to make it to the local market that day. There is also SuperU in Coustellet and L'Eclerc in Apt which have everything you need. Cozy Fruits à Coustellet is a high quality green grocer which also offers a section of cheeses, cold meats, groceries and wines and Poissonnerie Lo Traiteur de la Mer, also in Coustellet sells excellent fish and seafood.",
