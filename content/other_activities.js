For those interested in hiring bikes, there are several in hire shops in Bonnieux including the Lucy and Jo Thomson favourite - Sun-E bike. Given the hills, electric bikes aren‘t a bad idea, but for those of you in need of a physical challenge, why not take on Mount Ventoux which is a little over an hours drive from Ménerbes.",

There is an extensive and accessible network of walking paths and trails, linking villages that are often just a few miles apart. Walking trails are marked by small slashes painted on trees, rocks, utility poles, fence posts, and on buildings. In many areas of the Vaucluse - including the Luberon - there is also a system of signposts with bright gold signs at key trail intersections. A really beautiful walk to try is the 3 hour hike between Bonnieux and Lacoste.",

If you can visit the markets, they are always the best place to buy fresh Provençal produce and each day a different village or town hosts a market. Otherwise there are some great supermarkets too. Fresh in Apt is one of the best supermarkets in the area - it has a particularly good selection of local produce if you aren’t able to make it to the market that day. There is also SuperU in Coustellet and L'Eclerc in Apt which have everything you need. Cozy Fruits in Coustellet is a high quality green grocer which also offers a section of cheeses, cold meats, groceries and wines. Poissonnerie Lo Traiteur de la Mer, also in Coustellet, sells excellent fish and seafood.",

      "Our favourite film to watch to get us in the mood ahead of a trip back to Provence is “A Good Year“ - Ridley Scott‘s sentimental adaptation of a Peter Mayle story. Featuring Russell Crowe, Albert Finley and Marion Cotillard, it is filmed around Ménerbes and Bonnieux. Jo Thomson also enjoys watching “Jean de Floret“ - a 1986 French language film in two parts. If you enjoy that, then “Manon des Sources“ is the follow up.",
