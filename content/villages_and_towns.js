            `This is the closest village to La Bastide de Marie. The hill top village has a small car aprk as you you enter and then lots of nice little shops and cafes to explore with a beautoful view across the valley when you get to the top.

            Picasso once owned a house in the village and in the Place de l'Horloge at the top of Menerbes, opposite the town hall, is the Maison de la truffe et du vin (House of truffles and wine).

            At New Years they hold a huge trauffle fair in the village where large white and black truffles can be enjoyed over your omlette. Our favourite place for a long lunch or an evening drink is Bistrot le 5 or if you are just looking for a quick rose pit stop then pop inot La Poste.`
