    Picasso once owned a house in the village and in the Place de l'Horloge at the top of Menerbes, opposite the town hall, is the Maison de la truffe et du vin (House of truffles and wine).
    
    At New Years they hold a huge trauffle fair in the village where large white and black truffles can be enjoyed over your omlette. Our favourite place for a long lunch or an evening drink is Bistrot le 5 or if you are just looking for a quick rosé pit stop then pop in at La Poste.`,

    The village has 2 great boulangeries if you are on a morning croissant run and a village tennis court that you can buy a week long pass for (no better way to build up an appetite before a pain au chocolat, plus ALOT of Thomson Holidays have seen action on this court).
    
    The Beaumier hotel group have recently taken over the largest hotel in the village which is Capelongue which has two restaurants, one more high end cuisine and the other a more relaxed (and cheaper!) grill.`,

    It is beautiful to look at though, old village walls, cobbled paths, homes hewn into the mountain rock, and then the spectacular castle and church of Notre-Dame-d'Alydon above the village - a 10-minute walk up a stone path. Halfway up the path is the 19th century chapel of Saint-Antonin.
    
    The main square is a good place for a pit stop. NB you can't park inside the village but there is a parking lot out of sight just below the village.`,
